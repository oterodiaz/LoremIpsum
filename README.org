#+title: Lorem Ipsum

Generate the Lorem Ipsum placeholder text. Written in SwiftUI for visionOS 1.0 and later.

This application was inspired by [[https://apps.gnome.org/app/org.gnome.design.Lorem/][Lorem]] for Linux's GNOME desktop environment, as there were no alternatives for visionOS. The text generation algorithm was inspired by [[https://blakewilliams.me/posts/generating-arbitrary-text-with-markov-chains-in-rust][this blog post]].

* Installation
There is no way to install this application for the time being, other than compiling it yourself and running it on the Apple Vision Pro simulator.

* Build
You will need to have Xcode installed, which can be downloaded from [[https://apps.apple.com/es/app/xcode/id497799835][the Mac App Store]]. Lorem Ipsum uses no external libraries, so just clone this repository, open it with Xcode and compile it normally.
